author_description: "I am a student at BYU studying statistics with an emphasis in data science and a minor in computer science. I love sports, tabletop games, and music and looking for ways to incorporate data science methods within those. I am currently involved in sports analytics research and have worked on projects in basketball and hockey but am also interested in most other sports. I am always open to discuss anything related to data science, so if you have questions or comments regarding any of my posts, feel free to reach out!"
