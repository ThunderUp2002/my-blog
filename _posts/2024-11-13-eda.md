<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">F</span>all has some of the best college sports--football, women's soccer, and women's volleyball. But which college has had the best overall performance across all three? Read on to find out!</p>

### Introduction

I have always loved college sports, and the fall has three of my favorites: football, women's soccer, and women's volleyball. BYU has traditionally had quite successful women's soccer and women's volleyball teams, but the football team has been hit and miss. However, this year, they have been dominant. There are several other colleges that have very prestigious athletic programs, such as UCLA and Penn State. This made me curious--how does BYU stack up against other colleges, particularly those in Power Four conferences (ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, and SEC), in these three sports? I decided to gather some data and see what I could find out.

### Obtaining the Data

Fortunately, obtaining the data I wanted was not very difficult. I followed these steps to collect the data:
1. Find an API that has college sports data
2. Read the API documentation as necessary
3. Use the API to get query results
4. Parse query results

The API I used is called <a href="https://github.com/henrygd/ncaa-api" target="_blank">ncaa-api</a>. Seeing as this is a public API with no API key required, there were no concerns about ethics being violated. The format is very straightforward--you simply set up the desired endpoint using the URL of the NCAA webpage containing the data you want. For example, the endpoint I used (Stats) was reached using the following code:

{%- highlight python -%}

{%- endhighlight -%}

I then added onto the end the sport and which specific stat I wanted. Each one had several pages, so these were looped through, gathering the data from each page individually. The results were returned in a JSON format, which I then parsed and organized into a DataFrame, leaving me with a DataFrame from each page. These were stacked into a single DataFrame containing all the stats from a given endpoint, leaving me with a DataFrame containing various statistics for each sport. I then joined all DataFrames within a given sport by team, giving me a DataFrame containing all team stats of interest for each sport. Finally, each of these DataFrames were joined together by team, creating my overall DataFrame containing all colleges with their team stats for each sport they play. Here is an example code chunk of obtaining the

The full code for this process can be found in <a href="[Insert reference here]" target="_blank">this</a> GitHub repository, along with the resulting data.


### Digging into the Data

Once I finished cleaning the data, I was ready to start analyzing it! For this analysis, I decided to keep the process fairly basic, simply selecting one metric from each sport that I believe roughly shows a team's performance. Below is each statistic with a brief definition for those who are unfamiliar with any of them.

<dl>
  <dt>Average Score</dt>
  <dd>In football, this is the average points you score (or allow) per game</dd>
  <dt>Hitting Percentage</dt>
  <dd>In volleyball, this measures your attacking success, taking into account kills, errors, and total attempts <a href="https://volleyballvantage.com/how-to-calculate-hitting-percentage-in-volleyball/" target="_blank">(More info)</a></dd>
  <dt>Goals Per Game</dt>
  <dd>In soccer, this is the average number of goals you score (or allow) per game</dd>
</dl>

To account for both offense and defense, I took the difference between each team's statistic and their opponents' average, yielding a +/- differential for each one. The first thing you might observe is that the chosen stats from each of these sports are not directly comparable. To remedy this, I calculated the z-score for each statistic. If you are unfamiliar with what that is, it simply standardizes statistics on different scales using each one's mean and standard deviation, which makes it possible to compare one to the other fairly. After calculating these, I was interested to look at each sport's distribution of z-scores.

#### Brief summary of each individual sport (summary stats and maybe one graphic)
*Overview/summary statistics (tables)

| Sport       | Sample Size |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Football      | Title       |
| W Volleyball   | Text        |
| W Soccer      | Title       |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Total   | Text        |


#### Overall
*Filter to only those with all three sports as well

Since part of this analysis is specifically focused on which college had the best performance across all three sports, I took a look at the results when only considering colleges with a team for each sport.

#### Power Four Conferences

For those unfamiliar with Power Four conferences, you can think of them as the most elite "leagues" of college sports. They are considered the best of the best and thus are focused on the most when discussing college sports. Therefore, I felt it only made sense to take a look at teams from these conferences specifically since they often play the most difficult competition. Here is a list of Power Four conferences:
* <a href="https://theacc.com/" target="_blank">ACC</a>
* <a href="https://bigten.org/" target="_blank">Big Ten</a>
* <a href="https://big12sports.com/" target="_blank">Big 12</a>
* <a href="https://www.secsports.com/" target="_blank">SEC</a>

A couple of notable items regarding Power Four conferences:
* Surprisingly, Georgia Tech is the only college in a Power Four Conference that does not sponsor a women's soccer team
* Notre Dame is a member of the ACC for all sports except football, but for the simplicity of this analysis, they were included in the ACC for football

#### BYU

Finally, we'll take a quick look at BYU's stats for each of these sports and how they compare to other teams in Power Four conferences.
